Coding is only 50% coding. There’s documentation, collaboration, and version control. Believe it or not, if you’ve been coding for more than a few weeks, you’re ready to publish. You don’t need specialized skills if you have specialized knowledge or just a willingness to “dig in” for a few hours.
Here’s a small project of mine: [https://github.com/ShayHill/paragraphs](https://github.com/ShayHill/paragraphs). This project is much more documentation that code, but I use it all the time, and it’s there for me to install from anywhere whenever I need it.

# Here’s my 50+ and growing list of beginning project ideas

* Interesting Enum (e.g., Chinese Emperors). Anything canonically named and ordered is well expressed as an Enum. Save the rest of us a little coding and a lot of research
* Elaborate or fun predicates: Can a 16-bit value be converted to 8-bit without loss? Would a stack of `n` bricks be bigger than a bread box, but smaller than a billy goat?
* Sort items and keep track of original item index. This is an important first step in several algorithms
* Convert to fictional or archaic measurements (e.g., Roman digitus, gradus, passus)
* Permutations of a multiset. Vincent Vajnovszki has a [great algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397503002287)
* Dropped-object impact calculator. How hard and how fast did it hit?
* Vocabulary check against a favorite novel or author (e.g. identify words Melville didn’t use)
* Spline interpolation
* Yield only even or only odd permutations. The most common use for this is probably [constructing polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_cube#Cartesian_coordinates)
* Count combinations with duplicates. [How many ways can I line up four red vases and three green](/nassim-nicholas-talebs-dart-problem/)?
* Generate and format tests from a question bank
* Roman numeral converter. Yes, we still use these in MMXXI
* Map function that works with a specialized dataset, e.g., map(distance_to_library, coordinates)
* Approximate Bézier curves with circular arcs
* `datetime` (datetime is a Python library; every language has an equivalent) output in some ancient or fictional calendar
* Odds calculator for `2 * D20 + 4` style gaming rolls
* Strip or replace all non-ASCII characters from a string---sorry, Björn
* Give max height and distance of a projectile given initial speed and trajectory
* Integer to base-26 (Excel column numbering) converter
* Approximate oxygen percentage at a given altitude.
* Call an external command-line program (e.g., grep). Collect and parse output
* Build an html table that fits perfectly in a WordPress (or whatever) blog
* Iterate steps in a sorting algorithm
* Parse a module to create an argument glossary from the docstrings
* Break long text into n-character lines (or tweets)
* Partition a list based on a function
* Use introspection to create an output-file header with calling function, arguments, etc.
* [Clustering algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-clustering-algorithms-data-scientists-need-to-know-a36d136ef68).
* Sudoku solver or puzzle generator
* Reformat multi-line strings
* Recursive integer division (e.g., rediv(20, 6) => [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4])
* Equivalent of [Manhattan distance](https://iq.opengenus.org/manhattan-distance/) on hexagonal tiles
* Palette generator from a given color
* Rolling averages
* Solve triangles
* Generate output file revision numbers
* Useful `filter `functions (see Python’s attrgetter)
* Fetch temperature from somewhere on the Internet
* Parse module and create test functions to assert output type hints
* [Triangle centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_center) (if you’ve never looked, there are more than you think)
* Remove list duplicates, preserving order
* Pig Latin text converter
* Casino game odds reference
* Die Roller
* 4-dimensional rotation
* Switch between geometric plane definitions (3 points, point-normal form)
* Normal distribution cdf (without scipy or similar)
* Integer partitions
* Check for set/dictionary membership before adding element
* Capitalize strings as you would book titles: most words capitalized, articles lowercase
* Fetch conversion rates and convert currency
* Automate some other complex library call with sensible defaults
* Randomly generate names in a fictional language
* Approximate length of twine given a twine-ball diameter
* Algorithmically generated computer wallpaper
