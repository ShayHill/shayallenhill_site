# What is irony?

What does it mean when we say that a good story needs an ironic premise?

In *Reality Bites* (1994), Winona Ryder walks into our very own *Houston Chronicle* with the idea of becoming a print journalist. An interviewer challenges Winona to define irony. Poor Winona is still grasping for a definition as the interviewer all-but pushes her out the front door.

Let’s not get too fancy: irony = something else *should have* happened. So—if you prefer—”There is no story unless something else *should have* happened.”

It isn’t news when the train’s on time.

{% include ext-emphasis.html content="Let's try this with a sentence." %}

<blockquote class="large-quote" markdown="1">
I laughed at the joke.
</blockquote>

That sentence is clear and informative, but it isn’t ironic---it isn’t a story. Laughing is what *should* happen when you hear a joke.

{% include ext-emphasis.html content="Let's try the same with some explicit irony." %}

<blockquote class="large-quote" markdown="1">
I knew the comedian had been sleeping with my wife, but I still laughed at the joke.
</blockquote>

The narrator explicitly tells us why he *shouldn’t* laugh. His character is revealed when he does what he shouldn’t do.

{% include ext-emphasis.html content="The strength of an ironic *premise* is that irony can be *implicit*." %}

<blockquote class="large-quote" markdown="1">
I laughed at the diagnosis.
</blockquote>

… is a passable story on its own. There is implicit irony in the sentence because diagnoses are implicitly unfunny.

Which of the above three opening sentences would “hook” you into reading the rest of a story?

{% include ext-emphasis.html content="Irony is beneficial (necessary?) at every level of the story." %}

There would be no Superman without kryptonite. Which premise would you rather read?

* Demigod defeats man.
* Man defeats demigod.

Now, which would you rather *write*? Most writers want to write a badass, and tragedy is unfashionable, so we lose the advantage of an ironic premise (until the third act---the second act is necessarily some form of kryptonite).

In that case, we rely heavily on *explicit* irony. In other words, we tell the reader what *should* have happened. Nearly everything that happens in a good novel is

* the story as it is
* the story as is should have been

That blueprint has filled a lot of great pages. But, when we don’t know to look for it, we just see *stuff happening*. Look for it next time you pick up a favorite book.
