Here is my small contribution to the 96-mile hiking trail 1-hour north of Houston *that I should have known about many years before I did*. This supplement to the through-hiker’s guide at [http://lonestartrail.org/index.html](http://lonestartrail.org/index.html) has expanded trail notes and “How long to the next water?” indicators going both directions. I’ve been 1.5 times now, and it’s a great trip.

## A CONCISE THRU- HIKER’S GUIDE FOR THE LONE STAR HIKING TRAIL

In times of prolonged wet weather, the south half of Tarkington Section and the entire Winters Bayou section could be messy and difficult to hike, with unavoidable stretches of ankle deep water.
