# Meta

If you’re familiar with procedures, you’ve probably seen headings like “purpose,” “scope,” and “process.” Most likely, you’ve never seen a “meta” heading, but you’ve certainly seen meta content.

## Meta Content

Meta content is the tone, background, and justification for your procedure. Arguably, this content has a place, but that place is not in the body of your procedure. Put meta content in its own block or in a separate document.

### Meta Content Example

<blockquote class="bq_neutral" markdown="1">
Writing a procedure is difficult. Your job as a technical writer is to codify hundreds of pages of legislation, guidance documents, best practices, incident findings, technical knowledge, and company expectations into a set of clear, conformant instructions.

Your customer will have guidelines on the form and style of your document. These are not covered here. *This* article codifies hundreds of pages of loose guidance into a set of clear instructions.

You may wish to re-read this article, but you will never read *this* section again. Remember I said that.

# A Set of Clear Instructions

## Use big text for broad steps

Instead of using paragraphs to create a narrative:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
There are two primary goals when making a sandwich: avoid food allergies and avoid food contamination.

Clean the food preparation area with anti-microbial cleaner. Wipe down the fans and lights above the food preparation area.

To avoid food allergies when selecting food ingredients, avoid peanuts, bananas, and soy, also do not place bread, pasta, or ketchup food in the gluten-free preparation area. To avoid food contamination when selecting ingredients, only use food ingredients with a current inspection tag.

</blockquote>

Use Title, Purpose, Overview, and subheadings to provide context, guide readers, and highlight important content. Only use paragraphs for the small steps:

<blockquote class="bq_improved blog-content" markdown="1">
## Make a Sandwich

### Purpose

Define safe practices for avoiding food allergies and contamination during sandwich preparation.

### Overview

* Part 1: prepare work area
* Part 2: select food items

#### Part 1: Prepare the work area

Clean the food preparation area with anti-microbial cleaner. Wipe down the fans and lights above the food preparation area.

#### Part 2: Select food items

##### Avoid food allergies

Avoid peanuts, bananas, and soy. Do not place bread, pasta, or ketchup in the gluten-free preparation area.

##### Avoid food contamination

Examine each ingredient. Verify each inspection tag is current.

</blockquote>

## Use a person as the subject

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
A flotation device must be worn.
</blockquote>

Address the reader:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Wear a flotation device.
</blockquote>

Where required, address a position:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Gardeners will wear flotation devices.
</blockquote>

## Write instructions, not requirements

Instead of defining a requirement:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Personnel shall wear a flotation device.

</blockquote>

Give an instruction:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Wear a flotation device.

</blockquote>

## Avoid “which” clauses

Instead of combining two instructions, or an instruction and long description:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Wear glasses, which must have side shields.

</blockquote>

Remove verbs
(here: “have”) from clauses:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Wear glasses with side shields.

</blockquote>

Replace clauses
with adjectives:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Wear side-shield-equipped glasses.

</blockquote>

Create two
sentences:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Wear glasses. Glasses will have side shields.

</blockquote>

## Avoid “all,” “always,” “every,” and “at all times”

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Always inspect every load before any lift at all times.

</blockquote>

Eliminate redundant qualifiers:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Inspect loads before a lift.

</blockquote>

## Avoid redundant “don’ts.”

Instead of saying the same thing two different ways:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Wear long-sleeved coveralls. Do not wear short-sleeved coveralls.

</blockquote>

Eliminate the meaningless inversion:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Wear long-sleeved coveralls.

</blockquote>

## Avoid offering loopholes

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Where this is not practicable, the Crane Operator my allow the use of substitute tools under the following 27 conditions …

</blockquote>

The management system should have a deviation process. Allow this process to work as designed:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Use this tool.

</blockquote>

## Keep modifiers at 5 words or less

Instead of burying the instruction:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
In such conditions (high-velocity winds, heavy rain, compromised hull integrity, nuclear attack, etc.) that stability may not be guaranteed, …

</blockquote>

Use a short
modifier:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
In unstable conditions, …

</blockquote>

## Put the longest item at the end of a series

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Count the horses, only those chickens that lay eggs in the yellow barn beside the old cistern, cows, and pigs.

</blockquote>

Put the long item last:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Count the horses, cows, pigs, and only those chickens that lay eggs in the yellow barn beside the old cistern.

</blockquote>

## Format long series as lists

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Personnel with corrective lenses will wear prescription safety glasses; safety bifocals with side shields; or safety glasses or impact-type safety goggles over prescription glasses.

</blockquote>

Create a list:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Personnel with corrective lenses will wear one of:

* prescription safety glasses
* safety bifocals with side shields
* safety glasses or impact-type safety goggles over prescription glasses

</blockquote>

## Eliminate “whys.”

Instead of “selling” the instruction:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
We use LOTO as a means of protecting personnel from danger. It is critical that all equipment be locked out, tagged out, and tried out before attempting even routine maintenance.

</blockquote>

Give a clear
instruction:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Isolate equipment per MS-ABC-0000.

</blockquote>

## Do not paraphrase or quote other procedures

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Per MS-ABC-0000, seek authorization from the area authority and Installation Manager. Perform a job-risk assessment and confirm that all risks have been reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) before requesting this authorization.

</blockquote>

Refer to the
existing description:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Request authorization per MS-QHSE-00000.

</blockquote>

## Do not re-write or re-invent the control-of-work process

Instead of (outside the control-of-work procedures):

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Before using the hammer, identify potential conflicting operations. Ask yourself, “How could I get hurt?” Look above, below, behind, and inside.

</blockquote>

At most, instruct the reader to perform a risk assessment:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
Perform a documented risk assessment.

</blockquote>

## Do not quote directly from standards

Instead of:

<blockquote class="bq_opportunity" markdown="1">
Protection against the effects of noise exposure shall be provided when the sound levels exceed those shown in Table 1. For guidance on measuring sound levels, see ANSI S12.19-1996: Measurement of Occupational Noise Exposure; ANSI S1.13-1995: Measurement of Sound Pressure Levels in Air; and ANSI S12.36-R1997 Table 1. For guidance on measuring sound levels, see ANSI S12.19-1996.

<table><tbody><tr><td> <strong>Table  1—Maximum Permissible Noise Exposures</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Duration  per day, hours  </td><td>  Sound level  dBA, slow response  </td></tr><tr><td>  12  </td><td>  85  </td></tr><tr><td>  8  </td><td>  90  </td></tr><tr><td>  6  </td><td>  92  </td></tr><tr><td>  4  </td><td>  95  </td></tr><tr><td>  3  </td><td>  97  </td></tr><tr><td>  2  </td><td>  100  </td></tr><tr><td>  11/2  </td><td>  102  </td></tr><tr><td>  1  </td><td>  105  </td></tr><tr><td>  1/2  </td><td>  110  </td></tr><tr><td>  1/4 or less  </td><td>  115  </td></tr></tbody></table>

</blockquote>

Create an instruction that meets or exceeds the requirement:

<blockquote class="bq_improved" markdown="1">
The Company will provide hearing protection. Wear ear plugs when outside the living quarters.

</blockquote>
