For my son, the best of the advice you’re tired of hearing me give. Make your own life and write your own rules, but these are *yesterday’s* lessons, and you don’t need to learn them again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ask a friend before you ask the Internet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Don’t imagine what you *might* regret; remember what you *have* regretted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Never order a hamburger unless it says “hamburgers” on the door.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Don’t spend your attention where you wouldn’t spend your money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Try to think—only!—two steps ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Don’t confuse assumption with prediction—either nothing or everything is a coincidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Don’t choose what to give away; choose what to keep.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Tattoo a swallow on your hand the first time you sail around Cape Horn—and never before that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Remember 1.) that you have the power to shape your life; and 2.) that you’ve been using it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shop at the store with the worst return policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use the words “I” and “you” when you agree—and never when you don’t.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Occasionally ask yourself what you’d be doing if there were no such thing as money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Avoid sugar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* stop before you get carried away.
