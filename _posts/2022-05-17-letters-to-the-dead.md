I was a little late coming to the Internet. It wasn’t till around 2000 that I met my first online friend, Steve Paget.
I spent a lot of time alone back then, and–as you do–I would see things and “take a mental note” to later share them with my friends. The next day, I might tell my *offline* friends that, “Dude, last night I saw some baby ducks,” after which I might have five seconds of attention to transition this into something more dramatic.

But communicating with Steve was different. Steve and I only knew each other through writing. I didn’t have to gain and maintain conversational momentum. With Steve, I wasn’t stuck with “Dude, last night I saw some baby ducks.” I could instead start off with something like, “Ever since I was a child, I’ve enjoyed the coming of Spring, and with it … blah blah.”

Not only that, but I could then cross out “~~Ever since I was a child … blah blah~~” and replace it with

“~~I am ever impressed by the scope and diversity of … blah blah~~“

“~~I was reflecting on the meaning and complexity of …~~“

“~~You never know what you’ll find when you’re looking for …~~“

“~~With each passing year …~~“

“~~I was alone in the park after curfew when …~~“

“~~A clear and moonless sky …~~“

“~~If there’s one thing I know about ducks, it’s …~~“

“~~I’m not sure I would have bothered coming back at all if not for …~~“

“~~What a shame. Some people just can’t appreciate the simple beauty of …~~“

“~~I sure do love a mystery …~~“

“~~As a lifetime student of …~~“

“~~Do you know what goes great with plumb sauce? …~~“

… all before ultimately crossing out the last and settling for “Dude, last night I saw some baby ducks … blah blah.”

This was a lot easier than offline life, because conversation–and reputation!–were no longer about what I’d done, but what I’d felt. And, as anyone who’s tried both will know, feeling is a lot easier than doing.

In truth, it was even easier than that, because I didn’t *really* have to feel it: I just had to sell it.

To my credit (?), I usually crossed out the flourishes, but I did think about them. And as time went on, I thought about them too much. I began to forgot how to appreciate baby ducks–or anything else. Each notable thing I saw was auditioned as a metaphor for some lesson, proposition, or premise I might proffer to my online friends. There was a constant monologue in my head, pitching and pitching and pitching everything in sight as some gambit of persuasion or self aggrandizement.

Fortunately, I was pitching it to Steve.

Steve and I were around the same age, both married, both working class. And though I had a reasonable online audience, Steve was the one who came to mind when I was rehearsing my online voice. And Steve wasn’t having any of it. Both Steve and I came from a place and time where humility wasn’t just a virtue, it was an asset. This was when your whole life was a few hundred people, and they’d only bring you along as far as they could trust you. Unless you were a vagabond or a rock star, it was miserable to be a fraud.

I’ve never been a rock star, but I have been a vagabond. I’ve had an opportunity to see my most absurd, most extroverted self. And I know that having a mirror online in Steve helped me see where I was headed and change course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steve died several years ago. I know when, but I don’t know how. It didn’t seem right to ask when I heard the news from his real-life friends. I spent ten years typing back and forth with Steve, but I never did get a chance to literally speak with him. I have a hard time even imagining the Welsh accent he must have had living in Colwyn Bay, North Wales.

But sometimes I still catch myself “talking” to Steve. He’s still an accent-less voice in my head, reminding me that I don’t have to tell the living about every baby duck I see.
