What is coffee doing for you? or doing to you? Let’s try to find out. I tracked 14 health metrics for two weeks drinking 6 to 8 cups of coffee a day, then a tracked for another two weeks taking no caffeine at all.
I’m offering the results here, sans commentary.

**3/31:** I’ve had some erratic measurements from my [Whoop strap](https://www.whoop.com/). I tightened the strap this morning.

**4/8: **First day without caffeine.

**4/8** through **4/9**: I had a mild, only-there-if-you-look-for-it headache for about 36 hours starting the evening of the 8th.
