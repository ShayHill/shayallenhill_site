            <h3>Actionable Root Causes</h3>
            <p>Don't stop at "human error". People make mistakes, and nature
            can surprise us. Our goal is to design and work within a system
            where mistakes and surprises do not lead to incidents and injuries.
            Find the actionable policy opportunities that contributed to an
            incident and identify SMART corrective actions that address these
            opportunities.</p>

            <h3>You Did a Lot of Things Right</h3>
            <p>There may be centuries of combined experience incorporated into
            your safety systems. Incidents are rare, because your systems work
            hard to keep your personnel safe. A quality investigation addresses
            what went right, as well as what went wrong, so your systems can be
            improved exactly where it will count the most.</p>

    <h3>The Investigation is Just the Beginning</h3>
    <p>An investigation team can identify opportunities for improvement, but
    addressing those opportunities will require cooperation from the entire
    organization, sometimes multiple organizations. A thorough and well
    documented investigation report will convince your partners, personnel,
    families, clients, and decision makers that your corrective actions are
    necessary&#8212;and sufficient&#8212;to prevent future incidents.</p>
