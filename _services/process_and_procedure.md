            <h3>Step by Step</h3>
            <p>Have you ever read a "procedure" that was nothing more than
            re-stated regulations? Our job as safety professionals is not to
            pass along hundreds or thousands of do's and dont's to the front
            line; our job is to design a system of work that meets our legal
            obligations and company priorities. Front-line personnel should be
            able to follow a simple plan that will keep them safe, conformant,
            and productive.</p>

            <p>Nothing demoralizes like uncertainty. The number one request from
            field personnel has always been, "Just tell me what to do, and I'll
            do it." Give them a clear path to success.</p>
