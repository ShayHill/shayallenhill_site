            <h3>Knowledge Shared is Knowledge Squared</h3>
            <p>The more people who know about an opportunity, the more
            knowledge, resources, and creativity you will have to address it.
            This includes team members who may not have the time or opportunity
            to be involved in day-to-day operations. Key Performance Indicators
            provide visibility without overhead.</p>

            <h3>Use the Data You Already Have</h3>
            <p>Organize and compare data across your organization to reveal
            opportunities for improvement and recognition at any scale. Create
            org-wide, division-wide, and targeted initiatives based on clear,
            objective performance data. Allocate attention and resources where
            you <em>know</em> they will have the greatest impact.</p>
