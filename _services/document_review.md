            <h3>We Measure in "Gatsbys"</h3>
            <p>The Great Gatsby (we all read it in school) has 47,094 words.
            Each 50-thousand words of documentation you want your personnel or
            contractors to read is one Gatsby, or, at an average technical
            reading speed of 100 words per minute, about eight hours of
            dedicated reading time.</p>

            <h3>Not Just <em>Your</em> Documentation</h3>
            <p>These days, a good set of procedures is a legal requirement in
            many industries and a de-facto requirement in most others. In many
            cases, you will be legally obligated to follow these procedures.
            Your clients and subcontractors may have procedures of their own,
            in which case you will need to “bridge” or “interface” their
            procedures with yours to ensure all requirements are met. This is
            easier with a clear set of procedures, so clear procedures will
            make your business more attractive to potential clients.</p>
