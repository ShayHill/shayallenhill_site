            <h3>Build a Culture</h3>
            <p>Safety is everyone's responsibility, so it's everbody's job.
            But unfortunately we don't always come to work with the training we
            need to build a culture and drive positive change. Employees feel
            like they have to choose between working for change and "going
            along to get along", but this doesn't have to be a choice.</p>

            <h3>Master the Methods</h3>
            <p>We know how important risk assessment can be at all levels and
            stages of an operation. Risk assessment is a key component of every
            company's safety program. We have risk assessment procedures, risk
            assessment initiatives, and risk assessment campaigns. So why does
            risk assessment training so often consist of showing personnel a
            form and reading off the captions above the blanks?</p>
